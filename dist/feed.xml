                <p>Recently I heard a story where the Buddhist monk, Ajahn Brahm, asked another monk, “How can you make the water in a glass of water hold perfectly still?” The other monk held his glass of water in his hand as he looked at closely and tried his best to hold his hand with the glass perfectly still but the water kept moving ever so slightly. Finally, after watching for a while, Ajahn Brahm said, “The only way to do it is to put it down.”</p>
<p>Similarly, St. Francis of Assisi said to “Wear the world like a loose garment” which to me speaks to the same notion of learning to set the glass of water down.</p>
<p>This is all a lesson in learning to let go which is so important in our ever-changing world and ever-accelerating lives.</p>

                <p>Digital accessibility gets compared to curb cutouts. I hear it frequently in talks—hell, I’ve referenced it in talks before. Or sometimes people give the example of a door opening the “correct” way so that someone in a wheelchair can open the door with less of a struggle. I’ve started to change my perspective though. The most realistic analogy is that accessibility is the door itself.</p>
<p>There’s a few reasons for this:</p>
<ul role="list">
  <li role="list-item">these shouldn’t be add-ons, afterthoughts, or duct-tape covered form fields</li>
  <li role="list-item">the door ends up being used by and helping everyone</li>
  <li role="list-item">if your house is being built by a great carpenter, chances are that they’re going to build a door. They’re going to build a damn good door that is functional—and looks good—without you having to specify “edge cases” and afterthoughts.</li> 
</ul>
