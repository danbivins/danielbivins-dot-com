Recently I heard a story where the Buddhist monk, Ajahn Brahm, asked another monk, "How can you make the water in a glass of water hold perfectly still?" The other monk held his glass of water in his hand as he looked at closely and tried his best to hold his hand with the glass perfectly still but the water kept moving ever so slightly. Finally, after watching for a while, Ajahn Brahm said, "The only way to do it is to put it down." 

Similarly, St. Francis of Assisi said to “Wear the world like a loose garment” which to me speaks to the same notion of learning to set the glass of water down. 

This is all a lesson in learning to let go which is so important in our ever-changing world and ever-accelerating lives.
