        <h1>Jenzabar</h1>
        <h2 class="intro-sub">UI Component Design & Pattern Library Development</h2>
        <p>Jenzabar is an enterprise software company for higher education with large nationwide customer base. Various business stakeholders and the UX team knew that there was an urgent need to rebuild the product to be responsive and accessible.</p>

        <p>Given that this would take time to rebuild and shift time away from the backlog, this wasn't an easy sell to all product owners and stakeholders. After much back and forth discussion, the Design Team was able to move ahead, working at a rapid pace to design, build, test, and release components that would enable product teams to ship faster, more reliable code.</p>

        <h3>The Project</h3>
        <ul role="list">
            <li role="listitem">Utilizing user stories and competitive research, the goal was to build the right components needed for each user story.</li>
            <li role="listitem">A major issue that Jenzabar is working to overcome is updating design and code to meet WCAG 2.0 and AA accessibility standards to improve the experience for its users.</li>
            <li role="listitem">Build components in a modular way that allows for developers to "grab and go" the code that they need. This improves consistency in code as well as an increase in efficiency. This is classic "business needs meeting good design."</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>The Outcome:</h3>
        <ul role="list">
            <li role="listitem">With that motivation, these new components contain proper semantic structure and aria tags, where needed, ensuring users could navigate via assistive technologies. Creating this solid foundation for the software to meet accessibility guidelines while improving the experience for sighted users not only helps to meet business goals but is also just good design.</li>
            <li role="listitem">In the end, we drastically improved the time it takes to ship code by building out these components and making them reusable for developers. Below are several mockups of the UI component designs and pages from the style guide I created for Jenzabar.</li>
