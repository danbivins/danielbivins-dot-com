        <h3>The Challenge</h3>
        <p>Every year, millions of Medicare beneficiaries enter their Open Enrollment period, where they can find and enroll in the plan they want for the next year. The process of shopping for and enrolling in a plan is an intimidating journey due to the importance of the beneficiary's decision which affects their health and drug coverageâ€”but also due to the incredible amount of data that needs to be presented to the user in order to help them make the best decision possible. </p>

        <p>Our goal was: replace a legacy tool built more than a decade ago with a tool that would make it easier for Medicare beneficiaries, or those who help them, to find and enroll in a Medicare plan that best meets their health and financial needs. To do this we asked:</p>

        <ul role="list">
            <li role="listitem">Who are our users?</li>
            <li role="listitem">What are their pain points?</li>
            <li role="listitem">How do we prioritize all the features we can build to ensure that we have a strong foundation that we can improve upon in the future?</li>
            <li role="listitem">How do we ensure that we are continuously gathering feedback from those who will use the tool so we can improve over time?</li>
            <li role="listitem">How do we ensure that the tool is performant, stable, reliable, and most importantly accessible to all regardless of ability?</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>The Work</h3>
        <p>Working with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ... I joined the Medicare team at Ad Hoc after they had done initial research and rough prototypes. Right away, I began learning the ins and outs of the Medicare system, with all of its policy intricacies to best understand the ecosystem that, in the end, affects a beneficiary's experience while searching for and enrolling in a Medicare plan.</p> 

        <p>Following the successful Open Enrollment period, our team began the process to improve the MVP product we'd created and to better understand how people really used the tool.</p>  

        <p>Through user testing sessions during Open Enrollment, we saw how people actually used Plan Finder and began exploring the highest impact changes we could make to ensure an even smoother Open Enrollment the following year. There were many discussions around balancing the user impact and technical feasibility of the new feature work and feature improvements. Eventually we decided on focusing our improvements on: how people search for and select pharmacies and updating the plan results list and how the user filters that list.</p>
        
        <ul role="list">
            <li role="listitem">With that motivation, these new components contain proper semantic structure and aria tags, where needed, ensuring users could navigate via assistive technologies. Creating this solid foundation for the software to meet accessibility guidelines while improving the experience for sighted users not only helps to meet business goals but is also just good design.</li>
            <li role="listitem">In the end, we drastically improved the time it takes to ship code by building out these components and making them reusable for developers. Below are several mockups of the UI component designs and pages from the style guide I created for Jenzabar.</li>
